# TaxiApp
The TaxiApp project, developed as part of the Practical Exam for the Advanced Methods of Programming (MAP) course, represents a sophisticated taxi application designed to facilitate convenient and efficient transportation services for users. Leveraging JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI), incorporating database functionality, adhering to object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, implementing comprehensive testing procedures, and integrating a secure login system, this application offers a seamless user experience.

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
Within the project, OOP principles served as the foundation for creating a modular, maintainable, and extensible codebase. Classes such as User, Driver, Ride, and Payment Transaction were meticulously designed to encapsulate relevant functionalities and data, ensuring a clear and organized architecture. Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation were employed to enhance code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.

# Graphical User Interface (GUI) with JavaFX
The graphical user interface, developed using JavaFX, provides users with an intuitive and visually appealing platform to interact with the taxi application. Windows, buttons, input fields, and other UI components were crafted to offer seamless navigation and accessibility. CSS styling was applied to ensure consistency and enhance the overall aesthetics of the application, creating an engaging user experience.

# Database Integration
The integration of a database system into the TaxiApp project ensures secure storage and efficient management of essential data. User profiles, driver details, ride histories, and payment records are securely stored, enabling seamless retrieval and manipulation of information. This database functionality enhances data integrity, persistence, and scalability, ensuring a reliable platform for users to access their data across multiple sessions.

# Login Functionality
A robust login system has been implemented to authenticate users and grant access to the taxi application securely. Users are required to provide valid credentials (such as username and password) to access the application's features and functionalities. This login system enhances security and personalization, ensuring that only authorized individuals can utilize the services provided by the taxi application.

# Comprehensive Testing Procedures
Throughout the development process, rigorous testing procedures were employed to verify the correctness and reliability of the TaxiApp. By identifying and addressing potential issues early on, the application's stability, functionality, and user experience were enhanced significantly.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the TaxiApp project developed as part of the MAP Practical Exam demonstrates a comprehensive understanding and application of various programming concepts and technologies. By leveraging JavaFX for GUI development, integrating database functionality, adhering to OOP principles, implementing a secure login system, and conducting rigorous testing procedures, a sophisticated and user-friendly taxi application was created. The TaxiApp offers seamless navigation, secure login, efficient database management, and an intuitive user interface, ensuring a convenient and reliable transportation service for users.
